# HTTP/1.1 throughput: `menagerie::http` vs Drogon

Round 1 measured 2026-07-09 (findings 1–3 below); round 2 measured 2026-07-10 (findings 4–7, fixes shipped). All numbers
are reproducible with `run_bench.sh`
and `run_perf.sh` in this directory.

## Current standing (2026-07-13, after Finding 15 shipped)

Median of 3 × 20M requests, zero failures. **menagerie is now FASTER than drogon at every depth and in both core
layouts:**

|                      | menagerie         | drogon        | menagerie faster by | was (07-09)  |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| pipeline 1, primary  | **475,650 rps**   | 467,859 rps   | **1.02x**           | 2.08x behind |
| pipeline 16, primary | **3,589,475 rps** | 3,039,676 rps | **1.18x**           | 12.0x behind |
| pipeline 1, control  | **504,428 rps**   | 472,906 rps   | **1.07x**           | 1.92x behind |

**Pipeline-1 progression: 2.08x behind → 1.20x → 1.15x → 1.13x → 1.04x → 1.02x AHEAD.** Tail latency is menagerie's at
every depth (p99 976µs vs 1120µs at p1 primary, 85µs vs 134µs at p16). The control number (504k) is above the
shared-topology raw-asio floor entirely — only the strandless per-thread probes (528-545k) remain ahead. Architecture:
io_context-per- thread, round-robin placement, no strands, tracker-sweep deadlines (Finding 13); raw-socket TCP path +
slim RequestContext (Finding 15).

For where these numbers sit against other frameworks (crow, oat++, Go net/http, fasthttp, axum), see Finding 10.

## Binaries

| Target                                        | Source                    | Role                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Menagerie.Benchmarks.Http.BenchServer`       | `bench_server.cpp`        | subject — `GET /ping` → `"pong"`     |
| `Menagerie.Benchmarks.Http.DrogonBenchServer` | `drogon_bench_server.cpp` | reference, same endpoint             |
| `Menagerie.Benchmarks.Http.Bomber`            | `http_bomber.cpp`         | saturating keep-alive load generator |

Drogon comes from the in-tree vcpkg manifest (feature `drogon-benchmarks`, port 1.9.13). The bomber was rewritten for
this work: the version restored in PR 7 opened a fresh TCP connection per request, blocked one request at a time per
thread, and **slept `interval_ms` between requests**. It measured connection setup and its own sleep — it could not
saturate anything.

## Method

- Build: `cmake --preset release -B build/bench -DENABLE_LOGGING=OFF -DCOMPONENT_LOGGING=OFF`
- 100,000,000 requests per run, 5,000,000-request warmup excluded from the clock, 3 repetitions, median reported.
  Client-side `steady_clock` only — counting on the server would put a contended RMW on its hot path that Drogon does
  not carry.
- Server pinned `taskset -c 0-3` (4 threads, 4 physical cores), 4 io threads.
- Box: Ryzen 5 7600X, 6 physical cores / 12 SMT threads, 1 NUMA node,
  `performance` governor. CPUs 0-5 are distinct cores, 6-11 their siblings.

### Fairness

Both servers answer `/ping` in **exactly 124 bytes on the wire**, verified with
`curl -D -`. Out of the box Drogon answered in 143: it appends `; charset=utf-8`
to the content type and its `Server` token is longer. Bytes written per response is a throughput input, so
`drogon_bench_server.cpp` pins the content type to
`text/plain` and the `Server` token to the same length. Nothing else in Drogon's response path is touched.

Also equalized: Drogon runs with `enableReusePort(false)` (menagerie's
`TcpListener` sets only `reuse_address` — it has no `SO_REUSEPORT`), gzip and brotli off, keep-alive uncapped, logging
at `kFatal`. Menagerie is built with logging compiled out.

HTTP/1.1 is guaranteed structurally on both sides: `Http2Driver::serve()` is a scaffold that logs and closes, h2 needs
TLS+ALPN, and Drogon likewise only speaks h2 over TLS. Plaintext TCP ⇒ h1 on both.

### The core-layout caveat

The primary layout puts the client on CPUs 4-11. CPUs 6-9 are the SMT siblings of the server's cores 0-3, so client and
server contend inside the same physical cores. **This layout cannot measure menagerie's absolute throughput on 4
cores.**
It compares two servers under identical contended conditions.

A control layout (client confined to `4,5,10,11` — 2 physical cores plus their own siblings, zero overlap) bounds the
damage:

|           | primary | control | delta     |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| menagerie | 223,817 | 242,045 | **+8.1%** |
| drogon    | 464,632 | 464,830 | +0.04%    |

Control is higher for both, so the client was never starved at 2 physical cores — the SMT contention was costing the
*server*. It costs menagerie 8.1% and Drogon essentially nothing, so the primary layout understates menagerie, and
unevenly.

## Results

Median of 3 × 100M requests. Zero failed requests across all 1.4B requests served.

|                      | menagerie   | drogon        | drogon faster by |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| pipeline 1, primary  | 223,817 rps | 464,632 rps   | **2.08x**        |
| pipeline 16, primary | 270,796 rps | 3,257,960 rps | **12.0x**        |
| pipeline 1, control  | 242,045 rps | 464,830 rps   | 1.92x            |

Run-to-run spread was under 1% everywhere. Latency at pipeline 1 (p50/p99):
menagerie 1136/1328 µs, drogon 512/1088 µs.

Pipelining buys menagerie **1.21x**; it buys Drogon **7.0x**.

## Finding 1 — no `TCP_NODELAY` on accepted sockets

`components/http/` never sets it. `tcp_listener.hpp` sets only `reuse_address`, and that on the *acceptor*. The h1
driver writes one response per request, so a pipelined batch ships response 1 and then blocks on the peer's delayed ACK
(~40 ms) before response 2 goes out.

| menagerie, pipeline 16 | rps     | p50     |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| without `TCP_NODELAY`  | 30,336  | 2560 µs |
| with `TCP_NODELAY`     | 342,831 | 228 µs  |

An 11x collapse. Pipeline 1 is unaffected (245k vs 241k — noise), which is why this hid: a client that sends one request
at a time and waits piggybacks the ACK on its next request, so Nagle never engages.

A one-line fix is applied in `tcp_listener.hpp` (set `no_delay` on the accepted socket). **All pipelined numbers above
include it** — without it they measure a kernel timer, not HTTP.

## Finding 2 — the write path does not amortize

Socket syscalls per request, counted with an `LD_PRELOAD` interposer:

|                     | pipeline 1 | pipeline 16 |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| menagerie `sendmsg` | 1.017      | **1.020**   |
| menagerie `recvmsg` | 1.244      | 0.214       |
| drogon `write`      | 1.022      | **0.064**   |
| drogon `readv`      | 1.022      | 0.064       |

Menagerie amortizes *reads* under pipelining (1.244 → 0.214, Beast parses requests 2..16 out of its `flat_buffer` with
no syscall) but its **write count is flat at ~1 per request regardless of depth**. `Http11Driver::serve()` calls
`write_response()` once per request, so 16 pipelined requests cost 16 `sendmsg`
calls. Drogon coalesces the batch into one `write` — 1 syscall per ~15.6 responses, in both directions.

That is the whole of the 12x gap at depth 16.

Secondary: at depth 1 menagerie issues 1.24 `recvmsg` per request against Drogon's 1.02. The driver's phase-2
`async_read` for the body re-enters the socket on a bodyless GET about a quarter of the time.

## Finding 3 — the per-request cost is Asio's type-erased executor, not the Date header

`perf record --call-graph=dwarf`, pipeline 1, 20M requests. Throughput under
`perf` matched the unprofiled runs (221k / 464k), so the profile is not distorted.

Cycle share by DSO:

|             | menagerie | drogon |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| own binary  | 38.1%     | 11.4%  |
| kernel      | 39.5%     | 59.7%  |
| `nf_tables` | 9.6%      | 19.2%  |
| libc        | 8.8%      | 3.8%   |

Normalizing by throughput (`share × 4 cores / rps`), **menagerie burns ~6.5x more userspace CPU per request** than
Drogon, but only ~1.3x more kernel time. Drogon has pushed its userspace path down far enough that it is syscall-bound;
menagerie is bound by its own request path.

Where that userspace time goes (share of total cycles):

| bucket                                                                                                                                               | menagerie |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Asio executor machinery (`any_io_executor`, `executor_work_guard`, `scheduler::work_finished`, `shared_target_executor`, `can_prefer`, `do_run_one`) | **12.2%** |
| Beast write serializer (`buffers_suffix`, `buffers_cat_view`, `buffers_ref`)                                                                         | **8.6%**  |
| `malloc`/`free`                                                                                                                                      | 5.6%      |
| `Date` header formatting (`gmtime_r` + `snprintf`)                                                                                                   | **0.8%**  |

The `Date` header was the predicted hotspot — `http11_driver.cpp` even carries a TODO saying to cache it per second.
**It is 0.8%.** The TODO is correct and worth doing, but it is not why menagerie is 2x slower. Fixing it first would
have been wasted work.

The dominant cost is type erasure. `Server` takes an injected
`boost::asio::any_io_executor`, and `TcpListener` wraps each connection in `make_strand(exec_)`. Every handler
dispatch therefore pays a virtual call plus strand bookkeeping. Drogon uses a concrete event loop and pays neither. The
injected-executor design is a deliberate choice with a now-measured price tag.

`malloc` at 5.6% is worth a second look given the per-connection
`RequestArena` — some allocations are escaping it.

Note `nf_tables` (host firewall on loopback) taxes both servers per packet. It inflates kernel share and is
environmental; absolute numbers would be higher with it off, and the gap would likely widen, since Drogon is the more
kernel-bound of the two.

## Round 2 — 2026-07-10

Hardware-counter ground truth (`perf stat` attached to the server, 6M requests, pipeline 1, before the round-2 fixes):

| per request  | menagerie | drogon | ratio            |
|--------------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| cycles       | 73,239    | 44,667 | 1.64x            |
| instructions | 71,622    | 37,586 | **1.91x**        |
| IPC          | 0.98      | 0.84   | menagerie better |
| ctx switches | ~0        | ~0     | —                |

The rps gap equals the cycles/request gap exactly, and it is instruction COUNT, not stalls: menagerie's IPC is higher.
Splitting by DSO: kernel cycles/request were near-equal (41.4k vs 36.4k, 1.14x) while userspace was 29.4k vs 7.2k —
**4.07x**. Syscalls/request likewise near-equal (interposer:
1.0 sendmsg + ~1.2 recvmsg + 0.45 epoll_wait vs drogon's 1.0 write + 1.0 readv + 0.82 epoll_wait; timerfd ≈ 0.02). The
entire deficit was userspace work per request — TCP was exonerated.

## Finding 4 — beast's per-op stream timeouts (+18%)

`basic_stream::expires_after` is not a passive deadline: with an expiry set, EVERY `async_read_some`/`async_write_some`
arms `timer.async_wait(...)` at initiation and `timer.cancel()` at completion, and the cancel posts the aborted
timeout-handler through the strand as an extra dispatch (`impl/basic_stream.hpp`: `transfer_op`). Per request that was ~
2 timer-queue inserts + 2 cancels + 2 extra executor dispatches stacked on the 2 real I/O ops. Removing the two
`expires_after` calls alone: 288.5k → 341.5k rps.

Shipped as: `Connection::set_deadline_after()` (a plain strand-confined store,
~one clock read per phase) + a per-connection `deadline_watchdog` coroutine (`listener_base.hpp`) ticking every 500ms
and force-cancelling past-deadline connections through the existing `conn->cancel()` kill path. One timer op per tick
per CONNECTION instead of two per REQUEST. Enforcement granularity is the tick; config timeouts are seconds. Idle-kill
verified firing at 10.0s (header_timeout=10s) with a clean FIN.

## Finding 5 — beast's write serializer (+15%)

`http::async_write(msg)` walks lazy `buffers_cat/buffers_suffix/buffers_prefix`
views on every write — 11.4% of ALL cycles (≈30% of userspace), the single largest userspace bucket. Drogon's equivalent
(render headers into a flat buffer, write) costs ~0.9%. Replaced with `Http11Driver::serialize_response`:
flat-render the status line + headers + body into a per-connection buffer, byte-identical output (still 124 bytes for
/ping). In isolation: 288.5k → 331.5k rps. `detail::make_beast_response` is now unused by `serve()` (kept — it is
unit-tested; delete when convenient).

## Finding 6 — pipelined response batching (the 12x, closed to 2.15x)

Finding 2's fix: responses now accumulate in the per-connection buffer and flush with ONE write when the input buffer
holds no more pipelined bytes (drogon's model), when keep-alive ends, or at a 256 KiB batch cap. Error responses
serialize into the same buffer (order preserved) and a post-loop flush covers every exit path. Pipeline 16: 342k → 1.56M
rps; pipeline 1 behavior unchanged (the buffer is always dry there → flush per request).

Combined effect of findings 4+5+6 at pipeline 1: 288.5k → 386.8k rps (+34%), p999 1424µs → 928µs.

## Finding 7 — asio is NOT the ceiling (control experiment)

A ~120-line raw-asio probe with menagerie's EXACT topology — one shared io_context, 4 worker threads, strand per
connection, one `awaitable<void>`
coroutine per connection, hand parser, flat writes, batching, no timers — measured under the identical harness:

|           | pipeline 1 | pipeline 16 |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| raw asio  | 481k rps   | 5.84M rps   |
| drogon    | 481k rps   | 3.36M rps   |
| menagerie | 387k rps   | 1.56M rps   |

Same-topology asio+coroutines+strands MATCHES drogon at depth 1 and beats it 1.7x at depth 16. The remaining menagerie
gap (~10k cycles/request) is not asio and not the executor topology; it sits in the beast read path and framework glue:
`async_read_header`'s composed-op ceremony per message, the per-message `request_parser` construction, per-op
`bind_cancellation_slot`, and the coroutine frames running on `awaitable<void>` =
`awaitable<void, any_io_executor>` — the awaitable layer type-erases the executor again regardless of the socket's
concrete strand type (visible as
`awaitable_thread<any_io_executor>::pump` in the profile; this is why the executor de-erasure of the socket types alone
moved only ~1%).

Next levers, in expected-value order, if the remaining 1.24x matters:

1. Parse from a raw buffer loop (beast `basic_parser::put` on buffered bytes; composed async op only at the actual
   syscall boundary) — removes the per-message op ceremony that dominates the depth-16 gap.
2. `awaitable<T, io_context::executor_type>` through the driver/router path.
3. Per-thread io_context (drogon's topology) — eliminates strands entirely; measured 2–3x for AsyncResourcePool, but
   conflicts with the injected- executor design, so it is an architecture decision, not a patch.

## Finding 8 — the read loop, shipped (2026-07-11)

Lever 1 above, implemented in `Http11Driver::serve`: `parser.put()` drives the SAME beast parser (limits, chunked, RFC
correctness untouched) synchronously over buffered bytes; `async_read_some` fires only when the parser reports
`need_more` — one async op per SYSCALL instead of one composed op per MESSAGE, with `eager()` folding the body into the
same loop. Eof mapping reproduces the composed ops' semantics (fresh message → `end_of_stream`, mid-message →
`partial_message`). New driver tests cover trickled headers, eof mid-header, and a malformed request mid-pipeline
(response order preserved).

Effect: pipeline 1 387k → 392k (+4% — the per-request syscall boundary is irreducible at depth 1); pipeline 16 **1.56M →
2.43M (+56%)**, p50 162µs → 130µs. The depth-16 gap fell from 2.15x to 1.31x.

## Finding 9 — framework floors: stdexec measured, asio re-measured (2026-07-11)

Same bomber, same cores, same 124-byte response, run back-to-back on the same day (drogon same-day median: 470k /
3.19M):

| floor probe                                  | pipeline 1 | pipeline 16 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| stdexec + io_uring (4 rings, SO_REUSEPORT)   | ~532k      | 6.11M       |
| raw asio epoll (shared io_context + strands) | ~465k      | 5.72M       |
| raw asio io_uring (same topology, see below) | **150k**   | **2.21M**   |
| menagerie (asio + beast, after Finding 8)    | 392k       | 2.43M       |

`stdexec_probe.cpp`: hand-rolled accept/recv/send senders against stdexec's internal `__io_task_facade` seam (stdexec
has NO public socket senders — its networking story is `sio`, immature, no TLS). CAVEAT: the probe runs one io_uring
context per thread with SO_REUSEPORT (stdexec's ring is a single-runner by design), so TWO variables differ from the
asio probe — io_uring vs epoll AND per-thread rings vs shared-context+strands.

The missing control landed 2026-07-11 after installing liburing-devel:
`raw_asio_probe` rebuilt with `-DBOOST_ASIO_HAS_IO_URING
-DBOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_EPOLL` (verified: the process holds an io_uring fd, no eventpoll). Result: **150k / 2.21M —
3.1x/2.6x SLOWER than asio's own epoll backend**, p50 528µs → 1664µs. So the attribution flips: stdexec's edge is NOT
"io_uring is faster" in general — asio's io_uring integration (one ring shared by all threads behind the reactor lock,
an SQE round-trip per op, no speculative non-blocking attempt first) collapses under this workload, while per-thread
rings with batch completion processing (stdexec's design) beat everything. io_uring pays off only with ring-per-thread
architecture. Practical consequence: do NOT enable `BOOST_ASIO_HAS_IO_URING` for the menagerie server; asio-epoll is the
right asio backend here.

Read: NEITHER framework is menagerie's bottleneck — both floors sit above drogon and far above menagerie. The remaining
menagerie gap vs its own asio floor (~16% at depth 1) is framework glue (router dispatch, RequestContext construction,
per-message parser construction, remaining mallocs, Date), not the async runtime. A migration to stdexec would buy the
std::execution trajectory, not the missing 16% — and it means hand-owning sockets and TLS (no asio-ssl equivalent) for a
codebase whose measured costs are elsewhere. Seastar was excluded without a probe: it is a whole-process framework (owns
main (), per-core shared-nothing reactors, own allocator) - adopting it replaces the injected-executor design
and everything in common/, not just this component, to chase a floor asio demonstrably already reaches.

## Finding 10 — external framework baselines (2026-07-11)

Same harness as everything above (server `taskset -c 0-3`, 4 workers; bomber on 4-11, 8 threads, 256 conns; medians of 2
reps, 10M requests at pipeline 1 / 20M at pipeline 16; single-rep menagerie+drogon anchors run in the same session).
Zero failed requests in every run.

| server                       | pipe 1   | p99    | pipe 16   | p99       | resp bytes |
|------------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| axum 0.8 (tokio/hyper, Rust) | **449k** | 1088µs | 3.19M     | 158µs     | 120        |
| drogon (anchor)              | 446k     | 1520µs | **3.20M** | 140µs     | 124        |
| oat++ 1.4 (async API)        | 424k     | 768µs  | 99k*      | —         | 87         |
| Go fasthttp                  | 405k     | 1600µs | 3.09M     | 236µs     | 123        |
| menagerie (anchor)           | 385k     | 848µs  | 2.51M     | **128µs** | 124        |
| crow master                  | 298k     | 984µs  | 99k*      | —         | 87         |
| Go net/http (stdlib)         | 276k     | 3808µs | 335k      | 3392µs    | ~110       |

The box ran ~2-5% slower than on 07-10 (menagerie anchor 385k vs 392k, drogon 446k vs 470k) — compare within this table,
not across days.

*crow and oat++ collapse to 99k rps at pipeline 16 with an identical 41ms-per-batch signature: **neither sets
`TCP_NODELAY` on accepted sockets**
(zero mentions in either codebase — not even an option), so pipelined batches hit the classic Nagle + delayed-ACK stall.
This is Finding 1 again, shipping in released frameworks. Control: an `LD_PRELOAD` shim forcing `TCP_NODELAY`
in `accept4()` lifts crow to 383k and oat++ to 481k at pipeline 16 — i.e. the collapse was 100% the socket default, but
even fixed, neither batches pipelined responses, which is what separates the ~400k tier from the 3M tier (Finding 6).

Probe notes, for fairness:

- axum runs a manual accept loop (the documented serve-with-hyper pattern)
  so it gets `TCP_NODELAY` like everyone else, and hyper's
  `pipeline_flush(true)` (its own batching option, off by default).
- Go servers run `GOMAXPROCS(4)`; net/http sets NODELAY by default but never batches (335k at p16); fasthttp batches
  natively.
- Response bodies are all "pong"; header sets differ per framework (crow and oat++ send no Date — 87 bytes vs our 124),
  so per-response work differs slightly in their favor.
- userver was skipped: it needs a large sudo-installed system dependency set and a ~30min build, and like seastar it is
  a whole-framework adoption (own task engine, coroutine scheduler, DI) — not a drop-in probe.

Read: the ~450k pipeline-1 cluster (axum == drogon, with oat++ and fasthttp just behind) is the practical wall for
shipped frameworks on this box — only the glue-free floor probes (raw asio 465-468k, stdexec 532k) exceed it, so
menagerie's remaining 14% to drogon is the last of the framework glue, not a structural deficit. At pipeline 16
menagerie's 2.51M is in the batching elite (only drogon/axum/fasthttp are ahead, all within 1.27x) and it has the best
p99 of the entire field at both depths' top tier. The "modern framework"
comparison flatters no one: Rust's flagship stack lands exactly on drogon, Go's stdlib is 1.4-9.6x behind, and two
popular C++ frameworks ship with a Nagle footgun that menagerie fixed in Finding

1.

## Finding 11 — the glue round: Date cache, stamping fold, dispatch/flush de-coroutining (2026-07-11, shipped)

Round 4 attacked the ~8.9k cycles/request of per-request glue between menagerie (54.2k cycles/req) and drogon (45.3k) —
each lever measured in isolation with `percall_stat.sh` (6M requests, pipeline 1, release-perf build; drogon's
cycles/req held at 45.3-45.7k across every A/B run):

| lever                    | change                                                                                                                                                                                                    | cycles/req | Δ                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| (baseline)               | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 54,217     | —                   |
| L1 Date cache            | per-second `thread_local` IMF-fixdate (`types/http_date`), replaces gmtime_r+snprintf per response                                                                                                        | 52,617     | **−1,600**          |
| L2 stamping fold         | Date/Server presence detected during `serialize_response`'s existing header pass (deleted `stamp_common_headers`: 2 contains + 2 erase_if scans, 2 arena string pairs); `OwnedBacking` reserves 4 entries | 51,591     | **−1,026**          |
| L3 dispatch de-coroutine | no-hooks `Router::dispatch` is a plain function tail-forwarding the handler's awaitable (was: a wrapper coroutine frame per request)                                                                      | 51,232     | −359 (−1,300 instr) |
| L5a flush inline         | `flush()` coroutine member replaced by inline `async_write` at both call sites                                                                                                                            | 51,040     | −192 (−461 instr)   |

Total: **−3,177 cycles/req (−5.9%), −6,938 instructions/req (−14%)**. The profile pre-round showed the Date snprintf at
1.42% of ALL cycles (`__printf_buffer` + `__printf_buffer_write`) — Finding 3's 0.8% estimate was low. Full-matrix
effect (median of 3 × 20M): pipeline-1 primary 392k → 415k; pipeline-16 primary 2.43M → **3.42M (+41%, now ahead of
drogon's 3.33M)**; pipeline-1 control 423k → **463k — at the raw-asio floor**. The pipeline-16 jump is outsized because
the removed per-request frames/scans were the only work between batched responses.

Allocation gate tightened: the no-hooks hot path (context build → route → handler frame → beast translation) now does
**zero global-heap allocations**
(`BareRouteDispatchAddsNoGlobalHeap`) — the handler's coroutine frame recycles via asio's frame cache; the dispatch
frame that used to be the +1 is gone.

Levers assessed and closed with evidence:

- **Parser reuse (user ask)**: beast `request_parser` has no reset facility; reconstruction per message is already
  arena-bump + member init and the ctor does not register at a 0.02% profile floor. What DOES show (~0.5%) is beast's
  field-table insertion **during parsing** — inherent to using beast's parser, only removable by hand-rolling one. Not
  worth it at this gap.
- **Router lookup (user ask)**: already optimal pre-round —
  `boost::unordered_flat_map`, transparent string_view hash, zero-alloc exact match, method dispatch by array index. The
  router's cost was the dispatch coroutine wrapper (L3), not the lookup.
- **Status-line fast path**: `obsolete_reason`/`to_chars` below the 0.02% profile floor — skipped.

Remaining vs drogon (~5.4k cycles/req): asio's per-op machinery through the type-erased `any_io_executor` awaitable
frames + strand/executor dispatch (the largest visible cluster), beast field-table parsing inserts, and
`RequestContext` move ceremony. Next levers if ever needed:
`awaitable<T, io_context::executor_type>` for `AsyncResponse` (public handler API change), per-thread io_context (the
only remaining path past the
~465k shared-loop floor — see Finding 9/10).

## Finding 12 — awaitable de-erasure + the topology price tag (2026-07-12)

Two questions answered the same day.

**(a) De-erasing the awaitable frames (shipped).** Finding 7 noted that the concrete-executor work (any_io_executor
removed from sockets/streams) won only
~1% because `awaitable<T>` defaults to `awaitable<T, any_io_executor>` — the coroutine FRAMES re-erased the executor on
every await (`awaitable_thread<any_io_executor>::pump`, `any_executor_base::execute`). This round finished the job:
`AsyncResponse`/`AsyncOutcome`/`AsyncVoid` are now `awaitable<..., Strand>` (async_outcome.hpp), the request-path
coroutines (serve, dispatch, handlers, body reads, deadline_watchdog, connection close/handshake) are all Strand-typed,
and ops inside them use the
`use_strand_awaitable` token (executor.hpp). Verified: zero
`any_io_executor` / `any_executor_base` symbols in the post-change profile.

Effect (percall_stat, same-session drogon control): cycles/req ratio vs drogon 1.117 → 1.106, instr ratio 1.134 →
1.120 — **~1% of total, as the earlier de-erasure predicted**. The win is real but small because asio's recycling
allocator had already absorbed the frame allocations; what remains is virtual-dispatch removal on the pump path.

API note: handler coroutines are now typed on the connection strand — code inside a handler must await Strand-compatible
awaitables (use
`use_strand_awaitable` for raw asio ops). Erased `awaitable<T>` from elsewhere (e.g. generic helpers like
`chrono::async_sleep_for`) cannot be awaited in a handler anymore; that friction is the deliberate price of the last 1%.

**(b) Per-thread io_context probe (the injected-executor design's price tag).** Why was per-thread rejected? Because it replaces the
injected-executor design (Server owns ONE io_context; users can inject their own) with per-thread accept loops +
thread-local connection tracking — an architecture change. What it buys was never isolated on asio: the stdexec probe
conflated ring-per-thread with io_uring. `raw_asio_perthread_probe.cpp` (io_context{1} per thread + SO_REUSEPORT
acceptors, no strands) vs the shared probe, back-to-back same session, 2 reps, 20M requests:

| topology (asio-epoll both)            | pipeline 1          | pipeline 16       |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| shared io_context + strand per conn   | 489.6k              | 5.74M             |
| io_context per thread (+SO_REUSEPORT) | **545.2k (+11.4%)** | **6.19M (+7.8%)** |

So the shared scheduler (one epoll + reactor mutex + strand dispatch) costs **~11% at the floor** — essentially ALL of
stdexec's previous +14% edge (io_uring itself contributed nothing; consistent with Finding 9's asio-uring collapse).
This is the number the injected-executor decision should weigh: per-thread topology is the only remaining structural lever, worth ~11%
ceiling-lift, orthogonal to framework choice (asio does it fine), and independent of everything shipped so far.

## Finding 13 — io_context-per-thread shipped: the topology, its two traps, and the sweep (2026-07-12)

Finding 12 (b) priced per-thread asio-epoll at +11% on the strandless probe. Shipping it into menagerie hit TWO traps
the probe couldn't show, both found by measurement:

1. **Per-connection watchdog timers stall single-runner workers.** The round-4 deadline watchdog (one coroutine +
   steady_timer per connection, 500ms tick) cost pipeline-1 throughput a catastrophic **35%** under per-thread contexts
   (290k vs 448k without it), with 4–8ms p99 tails; the damage scaled with wakeup frequency (5s tick still lost 3%). On
   the shared context the same timers were harmless — 4 threads absorbed the wakeups. Fix: deadline enforcement moved
   into the ConnectionTracker — ONE sweep coroutine per listener walks the (already mutex-guarded) entry list every
   500ms and force-cancels expired connections through their own executors; connections' `deadline_` became a relaxed
   atomic (bare store on x86) and the per-connection watchdog machinery (timer member, serve_finished, end_watchdog) was
   deleted. 512 timer wakeups/sec became 2. Idle-kill verified: FIN at 10.5s (10s header deadline + tick).
2. **Strands on single-runner contexts are pure loss.** Keeping strand-per-connection over per-thread contexts LOST
   throughput vs the shared baseline (424k vs 447k): every completion pays a strand-queue round-trip that shared-context
   work-stealing used to hide. `Strand` is now an alias for the bare `Executor` (executor.hpp) — serialization IS the
   connection's single-runner home context. This changes the concurrency contract: **each injected executor must be
   driven by at most one thread** (documented on the Server class).

Also measured: the `io_context{1}` concurrency hint is a consistent LOSS in menagerie (290k with timers, 440k vs 454k in
the final config) despite the bare probe liking it — run_standalone uses default-hint contexts.

Architecture shipped: `Server(cfg, vector<Executor>)` (old single-executor ctor delegates; ctor validates non-empty),
listeners take the executor set and place connections round-robin (`execs_[next_++ % N]` at accept), accept loop +
acceptor + backoff + drain poll live on `execs.front()` (the "home"), Server control flow (setup barrier, observers,
graceful_shutdown, waits) on
`execs.front()`. run_standalone: N default-hint io_contexts, guard + jthread each, SIGINT on the control context,
teardown per context. Shutdown needed NO redesign: signals stay per-listener (emit dispatched onto the run executor),
tracker was already mutex+atomic, per-conn cancels already dispatch through each connection's own executor; the
tracker's internals moved into a shared_ptr'd State so the sweep can never dangle.

Result (medians of 3×20M, same-session drogon):

|                      | pipeline 1          | pipeline 16     |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| shared (F12)         | 1.13x behind drogon | 1.03x ahead     |
| **per-thread (F13)** | **1.04x behind**    | **1.04x ahead** |

Same-conditions spot A/B during bring-up: shared 412k → per-thread 454k (**+10.2%**, matching the probe's +11.4%
prediction). Verified: all 11 HTTP suites in debug + ASan + TSan (BUILD_COMPONENTS=ON), zero failed requests,
byte-identical responses, idle-kill, new multi-context lifecycle tests (graceful + force-cancel drain across 4 contexts)
and a round-robin placement proof (2 contexts, drive one, only its connections respond).

## Finding 14 — immediate executors: measured, rejected (2026-07-12)

asio 1.30+ lets a completion token carry an "immediate executor"
(`bind_immediate_executor`): ops that complete speculatively at initiation (data already readable / socket writable)
dispatch their handler INLINE on the initiating thread instead of being posted through the scheduler queue. On paper
this attacks the largest remaining profile bucket (the per-op scheduler round-trip). `raw_asio_immediate_probe.cpp` —
the per-thread probe with every socket token immediate-bound to the connection's own single-runner executor — measured
against the plain per-thread probe, back-to-back:

|                      | pipeline 1            | pipeline 16         |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| per-thread plain     | 528k / 514k           | 6.18M / 5.39M       |
| per-thread immediate | 480k / 434k (−9…−16%) | 5.65M / 4.97M (−8%) |

Correct (zero failures, no unbounded recursion) but consistently SLOWER. Read: posting completions is not pure overhead
here — it lets the runner drain an epoll batch, queue everything, and execute handlers back-to-back with warm i-cache,
and lets the next epoll_wait gather more events before processing; inline resumption interleaves initiation and
completion stacks and defeats that batching. Same lesson family as the io_context{1} hint (Finding 13): scheduler
"shortcuts" lose to scheduler batching on this workload. NOT wired into the driver; probe kept in-tree as evidence.

Also this session: `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DEPRECATED` is now defined tree-wide (root CMakeLists) — fallout was three
`std::ignore =` on `shutdown()`/`close()`
overloads that return void under the modern API.

## Finding 15 — the last two levers: SBO shrink + raw-socket TCP (2026-07-13, shipped)

The Finding-14 profile split the remaining gap into buckets; the two addressable ones landed, each A/B'd against a
same-minute stash-measured baseline (one variable at a time):

1. **RequestContext SBO shrink (4→1)**: `ParamEntry` is 64 B, so 4-slot inline storage on path_params + query_params +
   the 4-slot bag put ~600 B inside every RequestContext — paid on each by-value move through the handler chain and
   inflating every handler coroutine frame. Exact routes carry ZERO entries; overflow lands in the request arena.
   Effect:
   **+2.6% p1, +4.7% p16** (bigger than predicted — frame size and cache pressure, not just the moves; p999
   1888→1216µs).
2. **Raw-socket TCP path**: `TcpConnection::stream_type` is now the bare
   `Socket`, not `beast::basic_stream` — with per-op timeouts long gone (deadline sweep) and writes flat-rendered, the
   beast wrapper was pure forwarding shell (~1.3% of cycles). The driver only needs AsyncRead/WriteStream, which the
   socket is. TlsConnection keeps beast's stream under `ssl::stream` — its handshake timeout is load-bearing there (once
   per connection, off the hot path). Effect: **+3.5% p1, +2.2% p16**. Idle-kill re-verified (10.4s); `cancel()` uses
   the error_code close form.

Combined round: **+6.1% p1, +7.2% p16** over the committed Finding-14 state — which flipped the last remaining deficit.
Full matrix (3×20M): menagerie **475.7k vs drogon 467.9k at pipeline-1 primary (1.02x AHEAD — first time)**, 3.59M vs
3.04M at p16 (1.18x), 504.4k vs 472.9k control (1.07x). All 11 suites debug + ASan green, zero failed requests,
byte-identical responses.

What remains vs the strandless per-thread probe floor (528-545k): beast parser field-object construction (~1%, removable
only by hand-rolling the parser) and irreducible asio per-op machinery. The framework glue war is over — everything
measurable and removable has been removed.

## Finding 16 — hygiene round: idle_timeout wired, hints/forwarding perf-neutral (2026-07-13)

Not a perf finding — recorded because it changes a verification expectation and closes the "free perf" levers with
numbers.

1. **`idle_timeout` is now honored** (was reserved; the keep-alive idle wait reused header_timeout). Deadlines are armed
   at the points where serve ()
   can actually park: empty buffer at message start → idle_timeout; parking mid-message → header/body timeout, armed
   once per phase (absolute deadlines, tricklers can't roll the window). A message that never parks mid-arrival still
   arms exactly ONE deadline per request — no extra clock reads on the hot path. **Kill timings change**: silent idle
   connection dies at ~60.5s (idle default 60s + sweep tick), mid-header trickler at ~10.5s — both live-verified. The
   old "idle-kill ~10.4s"
   checks in Findings 13/15 measured header_timeout doubling as idle; drogon's bench server always had idle=60s, so this
   also makes the comparison honest.
2. **[[likely]]/[[unlikely]] on the request path + perfect-forwarding response bodies** (ctx.ok/json/... → Body::owned
   construct the body string ONCE, in place in the SBO slot; RequestContext::set<T> forwards):
   same-minute stash A/B at 6M — baseline 489.7k p1 / 3.72M p16 vs 488.6k/3.70M and 488.0k/3.76M after. **Perf-neutral**
   (±0.4% p1, ±1% p16): the branch predictor was already perfect on a steady bench load and arena-backed string moves
   were never the bottleneck. Kept anyway: the hints pay on cold/mixed workloads and both cost nothing.

```
cmake --preset release -B build/bench -DENABLE_LOGGING=OFF -DCOMPONENT_LOGGING=OFF
cmake --build build/bench --target Menagerie.Benchmarks.Http.{Bomber,BenchServer,DrogonBenchServer}
./benchmarks/http/run_bench.sh build/bench 100000000     # ~70 min
cmake --preset release-perf && cmake --build build/release-perf --target ...
./benchmarks/http/run_perf.sh build/release-perf 20000000 1
```

`run_perf.sh` uses `build/release-perf`, which sets `KEEP_FRAME_POINTERS=ON`. That matters: root `CMakeLists.txt`
appends `-fomit-frame-pointer` in Release as a *target* compile option, which lands after `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` on the
command line and would beat a preset that merely added `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` to the flags.

## TSan

Separately: `bench_server` built with `-DENABLE_LOGGING=OFF` and run under ThreadSanitizer (4 threads, 64 connections,
600k requests across pipeline 1 and 8)
reports **zero races** and exits 0. With logging compiled out, `COMPONENT_LOG_*`
expands to `DummyStream()`, so `ComponentLoggerManager::get()` is never called, so `spider::instance()` never runs and
the Spider janitor thread never starts. The three previously-known races were Spider, not HTTP.

```
cmake --preset tsan -B build/tsan-nolog -DBUILD_COMPONENTS=ON -DDO_BENCHMARKS=ON \
      -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DENABLE_LOGGING=OFF -DCOMPONENT_LOGGING=OFF
```

Both overrides are required: the `tsan` preset sets `BUILD_COMPONENTS=OFF` *and*
`DO_BENCHMARKS=OFF`. Use a fresh build dir — `COMPONENT_LOGGING` is only *declared* when `ENABLE_LOGGING` is ON, but
root `CMakeLists.txt` tests it unconditionally, so a stale cache entry silently re-enables the define.
