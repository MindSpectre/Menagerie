     * @brief Thin lifecycle orchestrator over the landed layers.
     *
     * The Server is HANDED one or more executors and owns no io_context and
     * no threads: the caller decides the thread<->context topology, and HTTP
     * coexists with the logger / DB pool / S3 client on caller-owned
     * executors. Connections are distributed round-robin across the injected
     * executors by the listeners (one io_context per worker thread is the
     * throughput topology); execs.front() is the CONTROL executor: setup
     * barriers, observers, and the shutdown coroutine run there. CONTRACT:
     * each injected executor is driven by AT MOST ONE thread - per-connection
     * serialization is the connection's single-runner home context (Strand
     * is a bare-executor alias, see executor.hpp). Every executor must be
     * driven for the shutdown-ordering contract below. setup() binds
     * synchronously, awaits the observers' on_setup_complete() as a BARRIER
     * (observer-owned resources exist before the first request is served;
     * the control executor must already be driven when observers are
     * registered), then co_spawns each listener's accept loop onto ITS OWN
     * strand (a stop emit is only safe when serialized with the loop's
     * turns) bound to ITS OWN cancellation signal (a slot holds one
     * handler). stop() is non-blocking + idempotent and NEVER stops the
     * executors. Shutdown ordering contract: after stop(), keep driving ALL
     * executors until wait_until_stopped() / async_wait_stopped() returns -
     * only THEN tear them down. wait_until_stopped() must be called from a
     * thread NOT driving any executor (use async_wait_stopped() there).
     *
     * Build phase (add_* / in_group) is single-threaded by contract; any
     * registration after setup() throws std::logic_error. A correct caller
     * destroys the Server only after wait_until_stopped() returned; the
     * destructor is an RAII backstop that runs the stop->wait sequence itself
     * (see ~Server()).
