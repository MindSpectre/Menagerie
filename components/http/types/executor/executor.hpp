     * @brief The concrete executor types the server runs on.
     *
     * These were `boost::asio::any_io_executor` until the throughput work.
     * `any_io_executor` is a type-erased executor: every dispatch through it is
     * a virtual call plus shared-ptr refcounting on the target. That is
     * tolerable at setup and shutdown, but `beast::tcp_stream` is
     * `basic_stream<tcp, any_io_executor, ...>` - so the erasure sat on the
     * REQUEST hot path, in every async_read_header / async_read / async_write of
     * the h1 session loop. `perf` attributed 14.25% of all cycles to it
     * (any_executor_base::move_shared, shared_target_executor, can_prefer,
     * executor_work_guard<any_io_executor>, ...), against 0% for Drogon.
     *
     * Fixing this costs the ability to drive the Server from a `thread_pool` or
     * other foreign executor. Nothing in the tree ever did - every construction
     * site already passes `io_context::executor_type` via `ioc.get_executor()`.
     *
     * Concurrency contract: each injected executor must be driven by AT MOST
     * ONE thread ("io_context per worker thread"). `Strand` - historically
     * `strand<Executor>`, serializing one connection's I/O on a shared
     * multi-threaded context - is now an alias for the bare executor: the
     * single runner of the connection's home context IS the serialization.
     * Real strands measurably hurt this topology (every completion pays a
     * strand-queue round-trip that shared-context work-stealing used to hide);
     * the alias is kept so connection/driver/handler types keep reading
     * "Strand" where per-connection serialization is meant.
